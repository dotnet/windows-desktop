# Traditional Desktop Applications.

Since the earlier Microsoft Windows versions, different tools were created by Microsoft partners to develop desktop applications. The first version of Microsoft Visual Studio with Visual Basic, and later Visual Studio .NET, were  the most familiar IDEs used by thousands of developers to create desktop applications.

Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) was the core technology used for developing desktop applications.
From small to big projects, Windows Form application was the predominant choice. Companies using the productive user interface provided by Windows Forms were able to develop enterprise applications for internal use, as well as end-user applications to sell in the market.
Microsoft Windows Desktop Applications developed under Windows Forms and WPF can be configured to provide a variety of user interface (UI) options. The developer can create forms of various sizes and shapes and customize them to the user's needs. Windows Forms are hosts for controls which provides the central functionality of the UI. 

WPF is the successor to Windows Forms for desktop application development. WPF applications differ from traditional Windows Forms applications in several ways. The most notable of the lot is that the code for the user interface is separate from the code for application functionality. Although the code for the functionality of a project can be defined using familiar languages such as Microsoft Visual Basic .NET or Microsoft Visual C#, the user interface of a WPF project is typically defined using a declarative syntax called Extensible Application Mark-up Language (XAML).
