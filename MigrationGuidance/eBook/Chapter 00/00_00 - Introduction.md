# Introduction

.NET Core is Microsoft's cross-platform, open source, modernization remake of the 17-year-old .NET Framework that's tightly coupled to Windows.
At the time of writing this eBook, new functionalities have been added to .NET Core 3 Preview 4 to support desktop application development. This is one of the last parts of the .NET Framework to be moved to the new platform, considering the tightly coupled nature of desktop apps and Windows. 
Support for creating Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms (WinForms) applications was a major part of the .NET Core 3 previews and continues in the new release. 
This release also brings the deployment flexibility of .NET Core to the rich set of APIs and functionality that desktop developers demand from .NET Framework. The eBook primarily focuses on a new way to update Windows Form, WPF and UWP applications to a new version of .NET without refreshing the entire OS.
The next generation of application container termed MSIX, inherits all the great features from UWP including reliable installation and updating,  managed security model, support for enterprise deployment, and access to Microsoft store. We are making it easier to take any app or game packaged as an MSI and up-level it to MSIX. This whole new paradigm opens up an exciting world of opportunity that takes desktop applications on a journey to modernize them and improve their agility..
