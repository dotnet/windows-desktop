## Benefits of Open Source

Open Source is the term assigned to software distributed under a license that allows access to the source code. This type of license allows the study and modification of the software with total freedom. Besides, redistribution is permitted as long as they respect and keep the terms of the license under which the software is acquired.

Nowadays, the leading companies position themselves for an Open Source model because of the advantages it offers.

- Quality: As open source projects gain users, more people contribute to software improvement. Searching and correcting errors. A continuous improvement of the project.

- Security and openness: Having the code exposed shows the complete flow of data and all its logic. The community can detect any security vulnerability and corrected level of transparency that generates greater trust by users.

- Collaboration: Open Source facilitates collaboration between companies that may be competing with each other. This saves time and money by working on the same focus.

- Standards:  A successful Open Source project can establish a standard way of doing things to the rest of the community without the risk of private agents.

- Customization: Provides complete freedom to realize custom solutions. Having access to the code, you can modify, extend by creating your version to your liking.

- Innovation: Exposing and sharing work is more difficult when the software is closed and private. Today, thanks to Open Source innovation in the cloud, the web is more significant, thanks to the fact that the leading companies together with Microsoft, are betting on this model.  

- Cost: All the advantages mentioned above affect the cost-benefit of software development: higher quality, security, collaboration, innovation â€” the possibility to focus resources and improve decisions focusing on the result towards a successful path.

Microsoft has been making changes for years and adopting the Open Source model. In 2014 the .Net Foundation was created with the target of defending the need for the .NET ecosystem and promoting open and collaborative development. Since its creation, more than 50 projects have been supported. Not only with support from Microsoft but also sponsors such as Red Hat, JetBrains, Google, Unity, Samsung are part of it, which along with more than 60,000 users contribute to improve every day the future of .NET in projects such as ASP.NET Core, ML.NET, Roslyn, Entity Framework among others where of course is .NetCore. Also for the first time the three leading UX development technologies of Windows: WPF, Windows Forms and WinUI, are Open Source, public and available through their GitHub repositories that can be found at https://github.com/dotnet.

Since 2016 Microsoft belongs to the Linux Foundation as a platinum member and one of the most significant contributors to Linux. It is no secret that in the past there was friction with the open source community. But those times are behind Microsoft and us today is one of the leading companies that support and adapts Open Source in all its projects. In October 2018 it announced its incorporation to the Open Invention Network ("OIN"), a community founded in November 2005 to use the patent portfolio freely among its members avoiding risks. With its registration to the OIN, Microsoft grants free of charge more than 60,000 licenses, which means that all members are free to make, use or distribute technology of Linux systems without any fee imposed.
With this act, it ratifies more the bet that Microsoft has given towards the Open Source in benefit of all.
