> GOAL: _Focus on the new features of .NET Core v3 that are most relevant for desktop application development and migration_

Besides all the new exciting features in .NET Core v3, the highlight in this release is the support for Windows Desktop Applications.
The Windows desktop support includes support for Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and UWP XAML.
You will be able to run an existing application on .NET Core 3.0 and create new desktop applications from scratch using .NET Core while getting the advantage of all the excellent .NET Core features.

There are several benefits of using .NET Core in desktop applications, and some of them are worth mentioning:

 * Enables both machine-global and application-local deployment
 * Access to the full Windows 10 (WinRT) API
 * Ability to host UWP XAML controls in WPF and Windows Forms applications using XAML Island technology.
 * Ability to host UWP browser and media controls, enabling modern browser and media content and standards.

All these features are already shipped with the new full framework version, .NET Framework 4.8.
